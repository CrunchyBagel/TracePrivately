# TracePrivately
A sample app using Apple's contact tracing framework, as documented here:

https://www.apple.com/covid19/contacttracing

## Objectives

* Create a fully-functioning prototype that governments can rebrand as necessary and use
* Implement correct security and privacy principles to maximise uptake of said government apps
* Remain open source for independent verification
* Properly use the Apple / Google contact tracing specification
* Create a function server prototype that can be used as a basis for more robust solutions that fit into governments' existing architecture.
